# SIEM Threat Detection Lab – MITRE ATT&CK Simulation & Detection

## Project Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end **SIEM Threat Detection Lab** where **80+ MITRE ATT&CK techniques** are simulated on a Windows environment, and detection is validated using:

**Wazuh SIEM**  
**Splunk**  
**Sysmon + Winlogbeat**  
Realistic detection rules  
Dashboards and logs  

This repository includes everything needed to build, simulate, detect, and validate a hands-on detection engineering lab.

## How to Set Up the Lab

### Deploy Virtual Machines

Follow [`lab-setup/vm_config.md`](lab-setup/vm_config.md) for VM specs and setup.

### Install & Configure Components

| Component    | Setup Overview                                |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Sysmon       | Install + SwiftOnSecurity config               |
| Winlogbeat   | Forward Sysmon and Event Logs to Wazuh/Splunk   |
| Wazuh        | Install + load [`wazuh_detection_rules.xml`](detection-rules/wazuh_detection_rules.xml) |
| Splunk       | Install + load [`splunk_detection_rules.md`](detection-rules/splunk_detection_rules.md) |
| Kibana       | Optional: Use for Wazuh dashboards              |

### Simulate Attacks

Run simulations from [`attack-simulations/atomic_red_team_simulations.md`](attack-simulations/atomic_red_team_simulations.md) on the Windows machine.

### Validate Detections

- Alerts in Wazuh: `/var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.json`
- Alerts in Splunk: Search UI, dashboards

## Expected Outputs

MITRE ATT&CK detection coverage  
Logs from Sysmon forwarded to Wazuh/Splunk  
Triggered alerts for techniques like credential dumping, obfuscated PowerShell  
Dashboards in Wazuh and Splunk  
Final report summarizing results

## Important Notes

- This lab is for **educational purposes only**.
- **Do not use offensive tools like Mimikatz in production**.
- Always isolate the lab network.
